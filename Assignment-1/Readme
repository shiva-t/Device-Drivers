Write a kernel module for a virtual 3 axis accelerometer device (ADXL) with 10 bit digital output corresponding to each X, Y & Z axis. 
Each axis of this accelerometer device must be controlled using a single device driver. However, device driver, once activated, must create
a seperate device file for each axis and name them adxl_x, adxl_y and adxl_z for x,y and z axis respectively. 

User can perform system calls on any of the 3 device files in order to read accelerometer data for that axis. 
This device, when read, will return the current reading from the selected axis.

As we are not dealing with real hardware here, implement the ADXL device as a function in the driver which returns an 10-bit true random 
number for each axis, every time it is read by the user space application.

Write the device driver as a loadable kernel module. Also write the user space application to demonstrate the usage of adxl driver.
