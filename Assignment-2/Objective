This assignment is designed to experiment with the block device driver concepts learnt during the lectures. Write a kernel module to create
a DiskonFile block device called “dof” which is basically a user space file (/etc/sample.txt) being presented as block device to the system.

Your kernel module should write procedures to read from and write to this user space file whenever there is any read write request from the
kernel to block device dof. This block device should have 2 primary partitions (/dev/dof1 & /dev/dof2) and no extended partitions. Fill up
the MBR details in the appropriate sector. Block device size should be 512 KB with sector size of 512 bytes. Use diskdump utility (dd) to
demonstrate the details about your block device. Use cat command to write some data to your block device. Display partition information of
your device using fdisk.
